# Pricing-with-Climate-data
Doing some work with climate data in Subharan Africa and pricing data in local markets. Overall, we are attempting to see if there are any significant correlations with climate phenomena/change and price fluctuations. SO far we have a used a KNN approach to facilitate temporal and geospatial matching of market data with climate data, and performed descriptive anaysis on key metrics in the merged data frame.
